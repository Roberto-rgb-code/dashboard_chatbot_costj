# CostJalisco Dashboard with Chatbot

This project is a web application that embeds a Power BI dashboard displaying infrastructure projects, budgets, costs, status, and types for CostJalisco, part of the global Construction Sector Transparency Initiative (CoST). It includes an interactive chatbot powered by the xAI Grok model to assist users with information about the dashboard and CoST initiatives.

## Description

- **Power BI Dashboard**: Displays real-time data on infrastructure projects in Jalisco, including budgets, costs, status (e.g., in progress, completed), and types (e.g., roads, public buildings).
- **Chatbot**: An AI-powered chatbot (using xAI's Grok model) that provides transparency and accountability information, answering queries about projects, budgets, costs, and CoST's mission.

The initiative, CoST (Construction Sector Transparency Initiative), promotes transparency and accountability in public infrastructure projects across 19 countries, working with government, civil society, and the construction industry.
